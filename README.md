In this project, I built a toy Kafka clone using Golang to learn the language. I implemented functionality for handling APIVersions and Fetch API requests, and gained hands-on experience with encoding and decoding messages using the Kafka wire protocol. I also learned to manage network protocols, work with event loops, and handle TCP sockets, among other key concepts in Go.
